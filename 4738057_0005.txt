STATEMENT ΟΝ ΒυΡΙ-ΙΟΑΤΕ iMAGES

This reei of microfiim contains materiai
which itas paper color changes stainS, or
illustrations (some ot which may appear on
paqes mixed with printed text). in order to

ensure that aii text and iliustratiorts are ,
ΙΘςΙῠΙΘ, exposure settinqs must be changed.

Theretore, when text arici illustratione, exist
in a single image or when materiai
bacquouricis differ, such frames may need
to be exposed twice.

The first exposure reiiects the camera
operator's best effert to capture tite majority
oi the text; the second exposure retiects trie

camera operator’s best effert to capture

iilustrative materiai or the remaining text. it
is hoped that this practice witi result in a
microtiirn product that tuiiy serves the needs
of most researcrierS.
